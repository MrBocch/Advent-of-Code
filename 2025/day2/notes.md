*so bad*


Its so slow, there must be some way to do part1 without having to check each number
one by one?

Also my haskell code is really bad and ugly.

all the collisions between Data and Prelude is annoying.
Should probably read a "real world" haskell book, if you
are going to continue with haskell.

## part 2

The code is really embarrassing LOL, I didn't  knew how
exactly to check for possible patterns of two, so i drew it out
(found a interesting pattern)

if the length of the number is prime 
check pattern of length (1)

else check its factors minus itself
